            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            
            <h2>General Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>What technologies did you use to build this website?</h3>
            <p>This website is built using simple, standard web technologies: HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. I also use Markdown for content management to keep things simple and maintainable.</p>
            
            <h3>Why did you choose not to use a framework?</h3>
            <p>I believe in the power of simplicity. While frameworks like React, Vue, or Next.js are excellent for complex applications, they can be overkill for simple websites. Using basic web technologies results in faster loading times, better performance, and easier maintenance.</p>
            
            <h3>Is this website responsive?</h3>
            <p>Yes! The website is fully responsive and works great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The CSS uses modern techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure a good experience across all screen sizes.</p>
            
            <h2>Content Management</h2>
            
            <h3>How do you manage blog content?</h3>
            <p>I write blog posts in Markdown format, which is simple and readable. The JavaScript on the blog page converts the Markdown to HTML and displays it. This makes it easy to write and edit content without dealing with complex content management systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I add new blog posts easily?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! To add a new blog post, simply create a new Markdown file in the `src/blog/` directory. The blog system will automatically detect and display it. The format is very simple - just write your content in Markdown and add some metadata at the top.</p>
            
            <h2>Technical Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>How do you handle SEO?</h3>
            <p>Since this is a static website, SEO is handled through proper HTML structure, meta tags, and semantic markup. The site loads quickly and is easily crawlable by search engines.</p>
            
            <h3>Do you use any external dependencies?</h3>
            <p>No external dependencies are required! Everything is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This makes the site fast, secure, and easy to deploy anywhere.</p>
            
            <h3>How can I deploy this website?</h3>
            <p>You can deploy this website to any static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any web server. Since it's just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, it's very portable and easy to host.</p>
            
            <h2>Contact & Support</h2>
            
            <h3>How can I get in touch?</h3>
            <p>You can reach out through the contact information provided on the About page. I'm always happy to discuss projects, answer questions, or just chat about web development.</p>
            
            <h3>Can you help me build something similar?</h3>
            <p>Of course! I love helping others build simple, effective websites. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or need assistance with your own project.</p>
